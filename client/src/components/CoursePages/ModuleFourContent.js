                Module 4: Aptitude Tests and/or Writing Samples

                <li>
                Find out if you need to take aptitude tests and/or create writing samples (if you donâ€™t already know from Level 3).
                </li>
                <li>
                Take an initial diagnostic test for your aptitude test (if you are required to take one).
                </li>
                <li>
                Start training for your test and adapt your time plan if you need more time to prepare (if you are required to take one).
                </li>
                <li>
                If you need to provide writing samples, you should work with your mentor on creating first drafts of them.
                </li>
                <li>
                Result: I know the format of the aptitude test, my base score, and I have a plan to train to improve my score to the level required for admission.
