                    Make sure you understand everything in the application system. Ask your mentor if you have any questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find out which references you need to supply and who would qualify as a referee. Some referees will let you help them write a reference, or at least create a “cheat sheet” for them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Result: I understand the online application system and I have a draft of a reference or a cheat sheet for my referee.
