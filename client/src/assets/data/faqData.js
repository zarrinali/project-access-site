    question: "How will the Bootcamp work?",
    answer:
      'You will be prepared for applications to top international universities with a range of different activities. Most of the content and activities will take place together with your seminar group, a group of 8-12 bootcamp participants. Each seminar group is led by 2-3 trainers. All trainers have studied at one of our target universities themselves. In addition to the activities in the seminar group, there are also other items on the program, such as "Mock Exams", i.e. trial entrance exams. For some participants we can also organize sample interviews with real admissions officers.',
